                        <p>Indus is tracing back the path of human migration since the dawn of civilization to understand the migration of music with them, and is searching for the numerous cultures involved in the course, and is celebrating the soul reflected in one another.
                        Indus is singing out loud the saga of humanity, sometimes chanting the Stotra of Upanishads, sometimes it is Desert Music, or the tunes of Kaddish; sometimes the Whirling Dervishes’ tune merges into Tagore Music; sometimes the mystical forms transcend to religion of man through Fado, Flamenco or even Jazz. Migrating Music is evolving a dialect to communicate worldwide, through music only.
