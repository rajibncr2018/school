                        <p>It is a two member band with a tenor voice from India and a bass from Bangladesh. </p>
                        <p>SOMALI has been the vocalist, a Sangeet Visharad from Lucknow Vatkhande Sangeet Vidyapith. Mystical genres of music from around the world and the musical notes from Indian subcontinent on that canvas has been her sphere of work. </p>
                        
                        <p>F Hossain, the bassist, has been a thorough rock musician playing in numerous leading bands in Bangladesh so far. His playing creates a soulful jazz tone while he converges with classical forms with strong trance and psychedelic overtones.</p>
                        <p>Together the tenor-bass combination creates the magic of mystical world to tell the story of humanity on stage.</p>
                        <h2>Migrating Music: A Genre in Making</h2>
                        <p>Indus is treading along the paths of the 5th century BC Greece to understand what actually spurred Alexander the Great to move this far with the entire panorama of Hellenic culture, and thereby to lay the foundation of the huge Hellenistic civilization. </p>
                        
                        <img src="images/about1.jpg">
                        <p>Afterwards, these immensely rich, in every possible way, population, living in the areas which the great emperor traversed and founded habitations in, including Persia, Turkey, and, of course, parts of Indian peninsula, became mere have-note with only the glorious cultural heritage,  and were commonly known as the Gypsies after their ever migrating character. </p>
                        <p>Toward the end of the 14th century, and early into the 15th century,  Taimur’s conquest resulted in immense destruction and loss of life in Persia and India. And the poorest of the poor people of the areas, I.e., the Gypsies, were the worst sufferers. Many of these wanderers, or the Gypsies, headed west, and some of them finally ended up in the early 15th century in the Spain, and, in particular, in Andalusia. This part of the world, the corridor of the Gypsies, incidentally, has been the cradle of Mysticism.</p>
                        <p>The world of Mysticism- the Kabbalah in Judaism, or Gnosticism in Christianity, or Sufism in Islam, or, else, Vedanta in Hinduism, or so on- is so varied, and yet emanating perhaps the same spirit- yearning to be reunited with Ultimate Reality through the path of love and devotion.</p>
                        
                        <p>Indus is tracing back the path of human migration since the dawn of civilization to understand the migration of music with them, and is searching for the numerous cultures involved in the course, and is celebrating the soul reflected in one another.</p>
                        <p>Indus is singing out loud the saga of humanity, sometimes chanting the Stotra of Upanishads, sometimes it is Desert Music, or the tunes of Kaddish; sometimes the Whirling Dervishes’ tune merges into Tagore Music; sometimes the mystical forms transcend to religion of man through Fado, Flamenco or even Jazz. Migrating Music is evolving a dialect to communicate worldwide, through music only.</p>
